# Bitcoin UX Research Toolkit

The UX Research Toolkit raises awareness for UX Research while making it stupid simple to carry out for builders. 

Builders need to create feasible, desirable, and usable products. And UX Research (UXR) is a practice that enables the creation of such products. 

However, builders often don’t know about UXR, don’t see how it adds value, or think it’s too difficult or expensive to carry out. The UXR Toolkit solves this.
